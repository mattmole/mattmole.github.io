During the last few years, I have really enjoyed using the [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) automation software to tie together various brands of home automation equipment I regularly use.

I have equipment of the following brand:

* [Ikea Tradfri](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/product-guides/ikea-home-smart-system/) lighting, motion sensor and socket
* [TP-Link Kasa](https://www.tp-link.com/us/kasa-smart/kasa.html)Wi-Fi plug
* Various [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) SBCs with temperature sensors and cameras
* [Google Nest](https://store.google.com/product/nest_learning_thermostat_3rd_gen) Thermostat
* [Google home mini](https://store.google.com/product/google_home_mini)
* [Google chromecast](https://store.google.com/product/chromecast)
* ESP8266 microcontroller boards, linked to Home Assistant with [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/)
