## Welcome

As the title says, welcome all! Many times now I've created a new website and said "this **will** be regularly updated." Well, let's see how I get on this time.

My aim is to blog about things I find interesting and that I hope will be help other people too.

Areas of interest include:

* Home Automation
* EdTech
* GSuite and how it can be used in an education environment. In this, I will focus mainly on the administration side of things as this is what I have most experience with
* Linux and Windows server maintenance
