# An Apology

It's been a little while, and for that, I can only apologise.

For all of February I have no excuse, apart from the usual nonsense of "I was too busy".

However, March, April and May has been spent largely working flat out on supporting and improving remote learning for all of the students at the Academy Trust that I work for.

We've prepared devices to go out to students, created google classrooms, both manually and with data from the school MIS systems, supported the staff, students and parents, created remote learning resources and many other things!

Working from home has been surprisingly OK. I've got my laptop and my two extra monitors and I've been able to work away upstairs and help with the kids when I can.

Hopefully posts will return more regularly!
